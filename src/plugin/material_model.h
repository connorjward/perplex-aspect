    /**
     * A material model that calls the thermodynamic software PerpleX
     * in order to evaluate material properties at a given point, namely
     * the density, heat capacity, thermal expansivity and compressibility.
     * The viscosity and thermal conductivity are globally constant.
     *
     * The usual PerpleX input files are required in the working directory:
     * an endmember dataset file, solution model dataset file and
     * option file. The path to a PerpleX input file must be given by
     * the user in the ASPECT parameter file; this file may be in any
     * directory. PerpleX output files will be written to the same
     * directory.
     *
     * Compositional fields are used to define the bulk composition at
     * each point. These compositional fields correspond to the
     * components as given in the PerpleX input file. The order of
     * components is preserved.
     *
     * This model requires PerpleX. A script to download and setup the
     * required files can be found in contrib/perplex. If the default
     * installation directory is not changed, cmake will automatically
     * find the required files during creation of the ASPECT build files.
     * See ./contrib/perplex/README.md
     *
     * WARNING: This model is extremely slow because there are many
     * redundant calls to evaluate the material properties;
     * it serves only as a proof of concept.
