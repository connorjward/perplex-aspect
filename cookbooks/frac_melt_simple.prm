# This model is an exact copy of the global_no_melt.prm cookbook from the
# ASPECT repository apart from the added particles tracking the phase 
# composition. The comments have also been removed to make the changes more
# obvious. The model was chosen because it is relatively fast to run and it 
# represents a region where partial melting occurs.

# not be recognised.
